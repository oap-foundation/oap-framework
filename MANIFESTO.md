# The OAP Founding Manifesto

Our Cooperation Charter

Preamble: We live in a time of exponential change. Linear structures and hierarchical thinking are relics of a bygone world. We are not launching this project to predict the future, but to lay the foundation for a desirable multiverse of futures. We are building an infrastructure based on European humanism and digital sovereignty. Our internal working methods reflect what we want to create externally in the world: **sustainable and reflective, collaborative and self-aware.**

## Our 5 core principles

### 1. People are the purpose, not the means.
Technology must serve human potential, not the other way around. Every line of code, every decision and every partnership is measured against this principle. Our personal AI is a tool for empowering individual sovereignty. The OACP protocol is an infrastructure for strengthening fair competition for all. We are not building ‘smarter’ cages; we are giving people tools for greater freedom.

### 2. We think in ecosystems, not silos.
The greatest challenges of our time are interconnected and complex. We can only solve them together. We reject rigid roles and ‘departmental thinking’. Our strength lies in our overlaps and our ability to enrich each other's perspectives as sparring partners. We act as a networked intelligence, guided by the joy and energy of each individual.

### 3. Transparency is non-negotiable.
Trust is the currency of the future. We build trust not through marketing, but through radical transparency. Our code is open source. Our governance is open. Our decisions are transparent. We combat the ‘black box’ logic of centralised platforms with the clarity of an open protocol. Every participant in the ecosystem has the right to know the rules of the game.

### 4. We build levers, not more walls.
Our goal is to empower small and medium-sized businesses and individuals, not to create new dependencies. We focus on strategic levers – such as software manufacturers – to give millions of businesses access to the AI economy. OACP is not a ‘walled garden’ but an open gate. We do not create new monopolies; we break down existing ones.

### 5. We are the first generation to actively shape the future as a resource.
We understand that our internal attitude shapes our external impact. We take the liberty to think and act non-linearly. We allow ourselves to act out of the joy of doing so, because we know that this is where the most sustainable and effective innovations come from. We take responsibility for building the infrastructure for a ‘humane market economy’ – as our legacy for those who come after us.
